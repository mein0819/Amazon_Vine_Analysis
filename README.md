# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze reviews that were written through Amazon's paid Amazon Vine program. This program allows companies to pay a fee to Amazon and provide products to the Amazon Vine members who then are required to leave a review. This project will use a dataset of music reviews to analyze whether there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. PySpark is used to extract and transform the data, and then to connect to an AWS RDS instance and load the data into a database in pgAdmin. PySpark is again used for the analysis of the positive reviews.
